# Hi, I'm Aryamaan Goswamy!

I'm a 16 year old developer passionate about data science. I can code in Python and I make apps using Flutter. I'm currently learning web development and cross-platform development using JavaScript.

I love music and I have been pursuing Indian classical music for more than a decade. I also produce and write my own songs. 

One of my childhood interests has been linguistics and I've been exploring it as a hobby.
